1. ABOUT
This asset helps you create dynamic panels using Unity's UI system. These panels can be dragged around, resized, docked to canvas edges or to one another and stacked next to each other as separate tabs.

2. HOW TO
First, add Dynamic Panels Canvas component to the RectTransform that you want to move your panels inside. This RectTransform doesn't have to be the Canvas object. It can be any child of it and can be of any custom size.

There are two ways to create panels: by using the GUI of Dynamic Panels Canvas or via Scripting API. There are also two types of panels: free panels that can be moved around and resized freely and docked panels that are moved by the layout system, depending on where it is docked to. A panel can have multiple tabs.

To add a new free panel using the Dynamic Panels Canvas component, simply click the Add New button under the Free Panels section in the Inspector. Then, click the + button to start adding tabs to that panel. Each tab has 4 properties: the content (RectTransform) that will be displayed while the tab is active, a label, an optional icon, and the minimum size of the content associated to the tab. To remove a free panel, select a tab inside the panel and click the Remove Selected button.

You can create docked panels by using the buttons under the Docked Panels section. To create a panel that is docked to the edge of the Dynamic Panels Canvas, use the buttons next to "Dock new panel to canvas:". You can click a panel inside the preview zone (immediately under the Docked Panels section) and edit its tabs. You can also dock a panel to the selected panel using the buttons next to "Dock new panel inside:".

When you are done, click the Play button to see the magic happen!

There are a couple of settings in Dynamic Panels Canvas that you may want to play with:

- Minimum Free Space: if its value is zero, docked panels can fill the whole Dynamic Panels Canvas. Otherwise, there will always be some free space that docked panels can't expand to
- Panel Resizable Area Length: the length of the invisible area at each side of a panel that allows users to resize a panel
- Canvas Anchor Zone Length: the length of the dockable area of the Dynamic Panels Canvas. When a tab is dragged and dropped onto that area, it will be docked to the edge of the Dynamic Panels Canvas
- Panel Anchor Zone Length: the length of the dockable area inside a panel. When a tab is dragged and dropped onto that area, it will be docked to the panel. This area is enabled only for docked panels (you can't dock panels to free panels)

NOTE: if you change the Resources/DynamicPanel.prefab, also make sure that the Panel's Header Height property is equal to the distance between the top of the panel and the bottom of the PanelHeader child object (which holds the tabs runtime).
